# @the-long-ride/skills-router

NPM/npx wrapper for the Python `skills-router` CLI.

This package exists so JavaScript-first tools, IDEs, and agent workflows can run
Skills Router through npm without vendoring the Python source into the npm
package. On first run, the wrapper checks the installed Python package version
and installs the matching PyPI release for the wrapper version.

```sh
npx @the-long-ride/skills-router --help
npx @the-long-ride/skills-router install ./my-skill.json --all-agents
```

## What This Package Does

- Provides the `skills-router` command through npm/npx.
- Uses your local repository source during development when `../src` is present.
- In published npm usage, installs the matching PyPI package version before
  launching the Python CLI.
- Keeps the npm package small: the real implementation lives in the
  [`skills-router`](https://pypi.org/project/skills-router/) Python package.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16 or newer.
- Python 3.10 or newer available as `python3`, `python`, or `py`.
- `pip` available for the selected Python interpreter.

## Package Links

- npm package:
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@the-long-ride/skills-router
- PyPI package:
  https://pypi.org/project/skills-router/
- Source repository:
  https://github.com/the-long-ride/skills-router

`skills-router` is the CLI command and PyPI package name. The npm wrapper package
is [`@the-long-ride/skills-router`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@the-long-ride/skills-router).

**Skills Router is an AI-agent skillset manager.** It reviews, registers,
discovers, indexes, compares, and routes AI-agent skills/plugins so a host agent
can use the right capability without silently taking over package resources.

Skills Router is not a general package manager. It owns metadata, decisions, audit
logs, and routing state. Package files, virtual environments, IDE extensions,
and host-agent skill directories stay owned by the tool that installed them.

## Why skills-router?

AI-agent skills are useful, but they get scattered across CLIs, IDEs, MCP
servers, global folders, workspace folders, and host-specific package managers.
That makes it hard to answer simple questions: which skill should this agent
use, who approved it, where is it active, and what happens if another package
overlaps with it?

`skills-router` gives agents one shared control plane for that problem. It lets
you install or discover skills once, review them through trust and behavior
checks, and route each agent to the right capability without copying package
files or stuffing huge route tables into prompts. The package manager still
owns package resources; Skills Router owns the decisions, metadata, audit
trail, and routing layer.

## What It Does

- Reviews complete skill/plugin manifests through trust, dependency, semantic,
  capability, and health checks.
- Stores approved package metadata in a Brain Index.
- Writes `skills-router.json` rules that host agents can query through MCP or
  CLI.
- Installs a skill once for all configured AI-agent hosts with `--all-agents`
  or `/skills-router install <package> for all agents`.
- Supports narrowed all-agent installs with target lists such as
  `--agent-target codex,cursor`.
- Enforces target-aware routing when agents call `route_task` or
  `skills-router route --target <agent>`.
- Supports the default all-agent host set: `antigravity`, `antigravity-cli`,
  `antigravity-ide`, `codex`, `claude`, `hermes-agent`, `opencode`, `cline`,
  `cursor`, and `windsurf`.
- Treats partial installs as selective route activation, not partial package
  extraction.
- Removes Skills Router-owned metadata/routing on uninstall, then re-indexes the
  remaining route surface.
- Reconciles routes with `/skills-router index`.
- Discovers externally installed workspace/global skills with
  `/skills-router refine`.
- Scans shared and host-specific workspace/global skill directories, including
  nested system skill folders.
- Keeps newly discovered external routes at `needs_selection` until the human
  confirms activation.
- Publishes release descriptions from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section on
  tag pushes, with package links appended by CI.

## What It Does Not Do

- It does not delete package-owned files, repositories, virtual environments, or
  IDE/plugin resources.
- It does not replace `pip`, `npm`, IDE extension managers, or host-agent plugin
  managers.
- It does not auto-approve trust warnings, dependency conflicts, duplicate
  routes, or unknown behavior unless the human explicitly says to approve risk.
- It does not inject large route tables into agent prompts. Agents should query
  Skills Router dynamically.

## Install

```bash
# Core local install
pip install -e .

# Optional real embedding support
pip install -e ".[ml]"

# Optional pgvector backend
pip install -e ".[pgvector]"

# Run through npm/npx
npx @the-long-ride/skills-router --help
```

The default storage backend is JSON-backed local memory under
`~/.skills-router`. A local Node wrapper is available in `skills-router-npx/` for
`npx` and IDE workflows; see [GUIDELINE.md](GUIDELINE.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Review and register a local manifest
skills-router install examples/sample_manifests/weather_tool.json --scope global

# Review and register by registry package name
skills-router install writer-pack --package-type skillset --scope workspace:codex-local

# Install once and make routes visible to all configured AI-agent hosts
skills-router install writer-pack --package-type skillset --all-agents --json

# Install once but expose routes only to selected agent hosts
skills-router install writer-pack --package-type skillset --all-agents --agent-target codex,cursor --json

# Install the full package but leave routes inactive until selection
skills-router install writer-pack --package-type skillset --routing-mode selective_routes --scope workspace:codex-local --json

# Preview review decisions without writing state
skills-router install writer-pack --dry-run --explain --json

# Remove Skills Router metadata/routing only
skills-router uninstall writer-pack --json

# Reconcile already indexed packages and routes
skills-router index --json

# Discover workspace/global host-agent skills and refine routes
skills-router refine --json
skills-router refine writer-pack engram --json
skills-router refine --workspace-scope workspace:codex-local --json

# Ask Skills Router which route matches a task for the current host
skills-router route "draft article about release notes" --scope workspace:codex-local --target codex --json

# Let an AI-agent host execute a human slash request
skills-router chat "/skills-router install writer-pack for me" --target codex --agent-id codex-local --json
skills-router chat "/skills-router install writer-pack for all installed agents" --target codex --agent-id codex-local --json
skills-router chat "/skills-router refine writer-pack engram" --target codex --agent-id codex-local --json

# Expose Skills Router through stdio JSON-RPC
skills-router mcp

# Render bridge instructions for a host
skills-router prompt --target codex
skills-router prompt --list
```

## Command Surface

## One-Time All-Agent Installs

All-agent installs are a core workflow:

```bash
skills-router install writer-pack --package-type skillset --all-agents --json
```

The package is still registered once in Skills Router. The generated
routes are global, and each configured host reaches them through MCP or the CLI
bridge. Skills Router owns metadata and routing only; package resources
remain owned by the host package manager or skill installer.

Default all-agent targets:

```text
antigravity, antigravity-cli, antigravity-ide, codex, claude,
hermes-agent, opencode, cline, cursor, windsurf
```

Use `--agent-target` when a skill should apply to only part of that set:

```bash
skills-router install writer-pack \
  --package-type skillset \
  --all-agents \
  --agent-target codex,cursor \
  --json
```

When a target list is stored, route lookup respects it only when the caller
identifies the current host:

```bash
skills-router route "draft release notes" --target codex --json
skills-router route "draft release notes" --target cursor --json
```

For chat-shaped requests, agents can use:

```text
/skills-router install <package> for all installed agents
```

## Routing Model

Skills Router separates package presence from agent activation:

- **Package presence:** the host package manager installs or updates the full
  package.
- **Brain Index:** Skills Router stores manifest, trust, dependency, vector,
  behavior, and scope metadata.
- **Routing:** Skills Router writes `skills-router.json` packages and rules.
- **Selection:** route conflicts and externally discovered skills use
  `needs_selection` until the human confirms activation.
- **Lookup:** agents call MCP `route_task` or `skills-router route` with their
  target instead of reading route files directly.
- **Stale routes:** `index` marks missing packages `missing_from_index`; it does
  not delete package files.

## Refine And Discovery

`skills-router refine` closes the gap where a human installs skills outside the
workspace, for example through `npx`, a host-agent skill installer, or a global
Codex skill directory.

Discovery sources:

- Workspace skill dirs: `.agents/skills` plus host-specific dirs such as
  `.codex/skills`, `.claude/skills`, `.cline/skills`, `.cursor/skills`,
  `.windsurf/skills`, `.opencode/skills`, `.agent/skills`,
  `.antigravity/skills`, `.hermes/skills`, and `.kiro/skills`
- Global skill dirs: `$CODEX_HOME/skills`, `~/.codex/skills`, and the
  matching host-specific global skill dirs
- Nested skill folders, including `.system/.../SKILL.md`
- Global Skills Router state from `global_data_dir`

Blank refine discovers all visible installed skills. Named refine discovers and
reports only matching skillsets while comparing them against the visible route
surface. Chat-shaped `/skills-router refine` assigns workspace-discovered routes
to `workspace:<agent-id>` while still comparing against all visible scopes.

## Slash Commands For Agents

The Agent Bridge accepts natural human requests and turns them into strict
operations:

```text
/skills-router install <package> for me
/skills-router install <package> for all agents
/skills-router install <package> globally dry run
/skills-router install <package> skillset only needed skills for me
/skills-router uninstall <tool_id>
/skills-router index
/skills-router refine
/skills-router refine <skillset> <skillset>
/skills-router route <task>
/skills-router list
/skills-router inspect <tool_id>
/skills-router audit --tool <tool_id>
/skills-router watch --once
```

The bridge defaults install scope to `workspace:<agent-id>` unless the human
says global. `for all agents` means one global install for the default
all-agent target set; custom `--agent-target` lists are enforced by
target-aware route lookup. The parser removes filler words such as `for me` and
returns `human_summary` for short agent replies.

## MCP Tool Surface

`skills-router mcp` exposes:

- `get_agent_prompt`
- `parse_slash_command`
- `run_slash_command`
- `install_tool`
- `uninstall_tool`
- `index_routes`
- `refine_routes`
- `route_task`
- `list_tools`
- `inspect_tool`
- `watch_once`

Use `run_slash_command` for human chat text. Use the structured tools only when
the host already has clean arguments. MCP `content` text is intentionally
compact; full machine-readable data stays in `structuredContent`.

Structured MCP install calls can pass `all_agents: true` and optional
`target_agents`. Structured route calls can pass `target` so stored target
lists are enforced for the calling host.

## Supported Agent Hosts

| Target | Instruction locations |
| :--- | :--- |
| `antigravity` | `.agent/rules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `antigravity-cli` | `.agent/rules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `antigravity-ide` | `.agent/rules/skills-router.md`, `.antigravity/rules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `codex` | `AGENTS.md` |
| `cline` | `.clinerules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/rules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `kiro` | `.kiro/steering/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `claude` | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/skills-router.md` |
| `github-copilot` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `opencode` | `AGENTS.md`, `.opencode/agent/skills-router.md` |
| `hermes-agent` | `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| `windsurf` | `.windsurf/rules/skills-router.md`, `AGENTS.md` |

Render target-specific bridge text with:

```bash
skills-router prompt --target codex
skills-router prompt --target cursor
skills-router prompt --target windsurf
skills-router prompt --target codex --detail full
```

The default prompt is compact so persistent agent instructions cost fewer
tokens. Use `--detail full` only when generating docs or debugging an
integration.

## Configuration

`~/.skills-router/config.json` can override `SkillsRouterConfig` fields such as:

```json
{
  "storage_backend": "memory",
  "workspace_root": "/path/to/workspace",
  "workspace_skill_dirs": [".agents/skills", ".codex/skills", ".cursor/skills"],
  "global_skill_dirs": ["$CODEX_HOME/skills", "~/.codex/skills", "~/.cursor/skills"],
  "pgvector_dsn": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/skills_router"
}
```

## Release Automation

The repository CI validates Python, the Node wrapper, and package builds. On
tag pushes, the workflow can publish the npm wrapper and then create or update
the GitHub release. The release description is generated from the matching
`CHANGELOG.md` entry and appends links to:

- the tag-specific changelog
- the PyPI package:
  https://pypi.org/project/skills-router/
